                        Senator Eldridge, Representative Cronin, and members of the committee, my name is Yeshimabeit Milner and I am Founder and Executive Director of Data for Black Lives. 
                        <br><br>
                        And I am here to testify in support of S.1385 and H.1538, a legislation to establish a moratorium on government use of face recognition and emerging biometric surveillance technologies. 
                        <br><br>
                        Data for Black Lives is a network of over 4,000 scientists, activists, mathematicians, organizers and elected officials committed to harnessing the power of data to create concrete and measurable change in the lives of Black people. We are working To made data and technology as a tool for social change instead of a weapon of political oppression.
                        <br><br>
                        And we were founded right here in Boston, because while it is the home to the world's top research institutions and cutting edge technology, it is also sadly home to a long history of racial disparities and outcomes for Black and Brown people. 
                        <br><br>
                        We know that any technology is rendered invalid without the trust, consent, and collaboration of community and the people directly impacted. Face recognition technologies pose a direct threat to our individual and collective civil rights and liberties. For far too long data driven technologies have been weaponized against Black communities and communities of color, and face recognition, if we are not careful could turn the clock back hundreds of years back to the Jim Crow policies and lantern laws that sought to restrict confine and criminalize a Black people right here in this state and all over our nation. Under lantern laws People of color were required to literally hold lanterns to their faces when moving about at night. This just seems all too familiar.    <br><br>
                        We must recognize that just because a technology is new, doesn’t mean that it’s innovative, especially those that jeopardize the privacy, civil, and human rights of us all. I encourage you to be on the right side of history and to press pause on face recognition technology by government entities statewide. Our communities deserve a robust public debate to examine the complexities of this issue, and strong regulations to ensure that technology doesn’t infringe on our rights. 
                        <br><br> 
                        Thank you.
