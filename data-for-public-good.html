                        In 2019 The Twin Cities Innovation Alliance (TCIA) and the Coalition to Stop the Cradle to Prison Algorithm were instrumental in organizing and equipping parents, youth and community members in shutting down a problematic cross system data sharing agreement that integrated predictive analytics between the City of St. Paul, St. Paul Public Schools and Ramsey County, MN.  Data for Black Lives played a critical role in our success- now we are coming to you again for your collective support as a part of the D4BL network.  
                        <br><br>
                        We learned many lessons and identified additional emerging technological trends in education surfacing locally and around the country – without the knowledge, awareness and consent of communities. In response we decided to launch the Data for Public Good Campaign (D4PG) and landed on a national community co-research project as a first step.  Our goal is to do information gathering and data collection across 25 community sites, with the goal of creating a heat map that captures the emergence of Big Data, Predictive Analytics, Algorithms, Threat Assessments, Social Media Monitoring… in education and education ecosystems (i.e. juvenile justice, law enforcement, public health, housing…).

                        <br><br>
                        Our goal is to support community members in collecting local data on the emerging trend of Big Data, Predictive Analytics and Algorithms in education and to document where and how it is showing up.

                        <br><br>
                        Step 2. Watch the D4PG Informational Webinar 
                        <br><br>
                        Once you have confirmed your participation in the D4PG project we will share with you an informational webinar to review.  We’ve recorded an informational webinar which provides an overview of the project and introduces the team to get you started. This webinar highlights expectations for participation and eligibility.  We also share tools we’ve created to support your discovery process. We highly encourage you to view this webinar before attempting to complete the project survey. 
                        <br><br>
                        Step 3. Complete Pre-survey Exploration and Worksheet:
                        <br><br>
                        To complete the project survey will require participants to do some initial detective work to figure out where existing or emerging technological trends are showing up in your local community.  This might include reviewing city, county or school board meeting minutes, interviewing staff, web searches, asking others in your network. This data gathering process should be captured in your D4PG worksheet - provided.
                        <br><br>
                        Step 4. Complete D4PG Survey
                        <br><br>
                        The D4PG Online Survey is designed to collect information from communities across the country into a central repository where the D4PG team can begin to paint a picture about what is actually happening locally, regionally and nationally in regard to emerging technological trends in education.  All this information will inform the development of a heat map that traces where it is happening, what policies are in place and document how the community has been engaged in these efforts.
